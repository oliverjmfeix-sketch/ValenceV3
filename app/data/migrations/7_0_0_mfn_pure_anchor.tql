# Migration 7.0.0: MFN Pure Anchor
#
# Removes extracted-value attributes from mfn_provision entity.
# All MFN extracted data now flows through:
#   Channel 1: provision_has_answer (scalar answers)
#   Channel 2: concept_applicability (multiselect)
#   Channel 3: typed entities (Phase 2 — exclusions, yield def, sunset, freebie)
#
# BREAKING CHANGE: Existing MFN data stored as mfn_provision attributes
# must be re-extracted. The provision_has_answer data is preserved.
#
# New pattern flags added:
#   reclassification_loophole_detected
#   mfn_amendment_vulnerable
#   mfn_exclusion_stacking_detected
#
